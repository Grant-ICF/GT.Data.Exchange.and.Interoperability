      # Api Calls 
      The HMIS API is a RESTFul API with different endpoints returning data defined by HUD in JSON format.
      ## Base URL 
      The base address of the HMIS API will be the same across endpoints and will be provided by your HMIS.
      ## Requests

      Resources are accessed via standard HTTP requests in UTF-8 format to an endpoint. The HMIS API uses the following
      HTTP verbs:

      | Method  | Action                                                                                         |
      |---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | GET     | Used for retrieving resources                                                                  |
      | POST    | Used for creating resources                                                                    |
      | PATCH   | Used for changing or replacing resources and queries                                           |
      | DELETE  | Used for removing resources                                                                    |
      | OPTIONS | Can be issued against any resource to request CORS support                                     |
      
      
      ## Responses

      The HMIS API will return JSON or plain text in the response body.
      ### Possible Response status codes

      | Status Code | Description                                                                                                                                                                         | Methods               |

      ### Error response

      The HMIS API uses a single response to describe an error. This error response can be detected by the returned status
      code (`4XX` or `5XX`). 

      The response itself will be a JSON structure or plain text. In general the response looks like:

      ```json
      {
        "Error message such as PersonalID not found"
      }
      ```
      OR

      ```json
      {
        "PersonalID": "string",
        "FirstName": "string",
        "MiddleName": "string",
        "LastName": "string",
        "NameSuffix": "string"
      }
      ```
