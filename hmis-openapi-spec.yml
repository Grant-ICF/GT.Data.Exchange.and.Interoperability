    description: "# Api Calls\n\nThe HMIS API is a RESTFul API with different endpoints returning JSON data defined by HUD.\n## Base URL\n\nThe base address of the HMIS API will be the same across endpoints and will be provided by your HMIS.\n## Requests\n\nResources are accessed via standard HTTP requests in UTF-8 format to an endpoint. The HMIS API uses the following\nHTTP verbs:\n\n| Method  | Action                                                     |\n|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GET     | Used for retrieving resources                              |\n| POST    | Used for creating resources                                |\n| PUT     | Used for changing or replacing resources                   |\n| DELETE  | Used for removing resources                                |\n| OPTIONS | Can be issued against any resource to request CORS support |\n## Responses\n\nThe HMIS API will return JSON in the response body.\n### Response status codes\n\n| Status Code | Description                                                                                                                                                                         | Methods               |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 200         | OK - The request has succeeded.

This error response can be detected by the returned status\ncode (`4XX` or `5XX`) and the `Content-Type` header which will have a value of `application/problem+json`.\n\nThe response itself will be a JSON structure according to [RFC-7807](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807). In general\nthis response looks like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\",\n  \"status\": 403,\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\n  \"detail\": \"You don't have permission to access this resource.\"\n}\n```\n\n- The `status` property contains the status code from the response.\n- The `title` property contains short a human-readable summary of the occurred problem.\n- The `detail` property contains a detailed human-readable description of the occurred problem and usually provides more\n  insight into the resolution (if any).\n- The `type` property describes the _type_ of problem and can be used as a discriminator for problem variants with\n  additional properties. Type `about:blank` is the default and will only contain the aforementioned properties.\n\n**Example of a non-default problem type**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"/problems/violations\",\n  \"status\": 400,\n  \"title\": \"Bad request\",\n  \"detail\": \"The request contains one or more violations. Please resolve all of them and try again.\",\n  \"violations\": [\n    {\n      \"property_path\": \"/customer_id\",\n      \"in\": \"body\",\n      \"detail\": \"This value must be a valid UUID.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n> \n### Note\n> If a resource endpoint supports one or more of the problem types they will be documented as a possible response.\n---\n## Collection response\n\nIf the response is for a collection of resources its structure will always look like the following.\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    // applied query\n  },\n  \"result\": [\n    // 0 or more resources\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Resource 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Resource 2\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total\": 2\n}\n```\n\n- The `query` property will always contain the query parameters that have been applied to get the resulting resources.\n  These include all provided query parameters and those not provided, but with a default.\n- The `result` property will contain a list of zero or more resources matching the executed query.\n- The `total` property will contain the total number of resources matching provided query parameters.\n## Pagination\n\nIf a resource supports the `limit` and `offset` query parameters the collection response will only contain a subset of\nthe total available resources (a single page).\n\n- The `limit` parameter can be used to control the maximum amount of resource returned per page.\n- The `offset` parameter can be used to control the index of the first resource returned. E.g. `?offset=0&limit=25`\n  gives the first page of 25 resources. `?offset=25&limit=25` gives you the second page of 25 resources.\n\nThe response will always be a collection response in which the used (provided or default) values for `limit`\nand `offset` are available in its `query` property. The `total` property provides the total amount of resources available in the system which gives you insight in the total number of \"pages\" that could be retrieved.\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"limit\": 25,\n    \"offset\": 0\n  },\n  \"result\": [\n    // resources for first \"page\".\n  ],\n  \"total\": 34\n}\n```\n"
