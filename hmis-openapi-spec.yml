     ## Prerequisites

      To make use of this API you need to have an API key, User Id and User Secret.

      With those credentials you can request a token which you will need to access this API's resources.
      ## Retrieving a token

      To retrieve a token you need to make a POST request to your HMIS OAuth2 endpoint.

      Response body
      ```json
      {
        "access_token": "eyJraWQ.........",
        "expires_in": 3600,
        "token_type": "Bearer"
      }
      ```

      In the response body you will find your access token.
      ## Using your token

      To make use of your access token you need to add the following headers to your requests.

          Authorization: Bearer <your access token>
          x-api-key: <your api key>

      # Api Calls 
      The HMIS API is a RESTFul API with different endpoints returning JSON data defined by HUD.
      ## Base URL 
      The base address of the HMIS API will be the same across endpoints and will be provided by your HMIS.
      ## Requests

      Resources are accessed via standard HTTP requests in UTF-8 format to an endpoint. The HMIS API uses the following
      HTTP verbs:

      | Method  | Action                                                                                         |
      |---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | GET     | Used for retrieving resources                                                                  |
      | POST    | Used for creating resources                                                                    |
      | PUT     | Used for changing or replacing resources and queries that contain PII or sensitive information |
      | DELETE  | Used for removing resources                                                                    |
      | OPTIONS | Can be issued against any resource to request CORS support                                     |
      ## Responses

      The HMIS API will return JSON in the response body.
      ### Response status codes

      ### Error response

      The HMIS API uses a single response to describe an error. This error response can be detected by the returned status
      code (`4XX` or `5XX`) and the `Content-Type` header which will have a value of `application/problem+json`.

      The response itself will be a JSON structure according to [RFC-7807](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807). In general
      this response looks like:

      ```json
      {
        "type": "about:blank",
        "status": 403,
        "title": "Forbidden",
        "detail": "You don't have permission to access this resource."
      }
      ```

      - The `status` property contains the status code from the response.
      - The `title` property contains short a human-readable summary of the occurred problem.
      - The `detail` property contains a detailed human-readable description of the occurred problem and usually provides more
        insight into the resolution (if any).
      - The `type` property describes the _type_ of problem and can be used as a discriminator for problem variants with
        additional properties. Type `about:blank` is the default and will only contain the aforementioned properties.

      **Example of a non-default problem type**

      ```json5
      {
        msg: "SSN is invalid",
        error_code: "MISSING_SSN"

      }
      ```

      ---
      > 
      ### Note
      > If a resource endpoint supports one or more of the problem types they will be documented as a possible response.
      ---
      ## Collection response

      If the response is for a collection of resources its structure will always look like the following.

      ```json5
      {
        "query": {
          // applied query
        },
        "result": [
          // 0 or more resources
          {
            "id": "Resource 1"
          },
          {
            "id": "Resource 2"
          }
        ],
        "total": 2
      }
      ```

      - The `query` property will always contain the query parameters that have been applied to get the resulting resources.
        These include all provided query parameters and those not provided, but with a default.
      - The `result` property will contain a list of zero or more resources matching the executed query.
      - The `total` property will contain the total number of resources matching provided query parameters.
      ## Pagination

      If a resource supports the `limit` and `offset` query parameters the collection response will only contain a subset of
      the total available resources (a single page).

      - The `limit` parameter can be used to control the maximum amount of resource returned per page.
      - The `offset` parameter can be used to control the index of the first resource returned. E.g. `?offset=0&limit=25`
        gives the first page of 25 resources. `?offset=25&limit=25` gives you the second page of 25 resources.

      The response will always be a collection response in which the used (provided or default) values for `limit`
      and `offset` are available in its `query` property. The `total` property provides the total amount of resources available in the system which gives you insight in the total number of "pages" that could be retrieved.

      ```json5
      {
        "query": {
          "limit": 25,
          "offset": 0
        },
        "result": [
          // resources for first "page".
        ],
        "total": 34
      }
      ```
